# Jimidy's Faction Tools

A comprehensive web-based suite of tools for Torn faction management and analysis, built with modern JavaScript and optimized for performance.

## Local development (Firebase callables + `localhost`)

Gen2 Cloud Functions often **block CORS preflight** from `http://localhost` even when production works. This repo includes **Vite** with a proxy so callables hit `/.functions-proxy/...` on the same origin (no CORS).

1. `npm install` (once)
2. `npm run dev` — open **http://localhost:5173** (not Live Server on another port unless you add the same proxy there)
3. `firebase-config.js` automatically uses the proxy when `hostname` is `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`

**Production** (GitHub Pages, etc.) still calls `https://us-central1-…cloudfunctions.net` directly.
